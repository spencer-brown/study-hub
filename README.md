# StudyPool #

### A Rails app that allows Purdue students to collaborate on study guides (known as StudyPads) in real-time using Etherpad-Lite. ###

#### To-do: ####

##### High Priority #####
* Change default Etherpad text to show StudyPad instructions (how to use Table of Contents/header system, how to upload images)
* ~~Add footer~~
* Set Etherpad to have automatic height
* ~~Set up Subject-Course association~~
* ~~Create rake tasks to automatically load all of Purdue's subjects and courses~~
* ~~Adjust Courses navigation to be based on subject~~
* How-to-use instructions upon sign up
* ~~Think of a better name~~
* Finish homepage

##### Low Priority #####
* Scrape Purdue directory to generate students' names automatically when they sign up with their Purdue email
* Image resizing in Etherpads
* Change StudyPad route to show its name instead of its ID
* General refactoring
* When generating subjects, add names when available
